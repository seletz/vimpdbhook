MacVIM pdb hook
===============

Using this package one can enable a hook in the python pdb
such that the current file is automagically opened in MacVim
and the line is highlighted.

Features
--------

- Activates MacVIM, uses new tab to open debugged file
- reuses existing MacVIM instance
- after loading the file, the terminal program is activated
  (given focus) to allow for rodent-free debugging.
- The focus-switching is done using `appscript` which is a python
  package for AppleScript.

Dependencies
------------

- Mac OS X (duh)
- MacVim (or another gui-enabled VIM which understands the
  VIM server commands -- currently only MacVIM)

Usage
-----

- install this package
- put something like this in your `~/.pdbrc`::

    # save this in .pdbrc in your home directory
    from vimpdbhook import preloop, precmd
    pdb.Pdb.preloop = preloop
    pdb.Pdb.precmd = precmd

- make sure that you have also installed the `mvim` command line
  utility for firing up macVIM using the terminal.

- Currently, I assume that you use "iTerm" and use a variant of `mvim`
  called `vimpdb` (that's my setup).  Please see below.

Tweaking
--------

The package uses the environment to fetch the name of the terminal app and the
MacVIM launch script

VIMPDBHOOK_MVIM_SCRIPT
    Set this to your `mvim` script. default: `vimpdb`

VIMPDBHOOK_TERMINAL_APP
    Set this to the name of the terminal application. default: `iTerm`
